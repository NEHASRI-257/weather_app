##  Project Task Description — Sky Cast

As part of my work at *CodTech IT Solutions, I independently designed and developed a responsive weather forecasting application called **Sky Cast*. The aim of the project was to create a clean and reliable web-based tool that provides live weather conditions and short-term forecasts for any city around the globe.

###  Objective  
The primary goal of this project was to build a lightweight, fast, and mobile-friendly weather application using only core web technologies. The app had to deliver real-time data fetched from a third-party API and present it in a clear and accessible interface. An additional goal was to ensure excellent responsiveness and usability across different screen sizes and devices. Throughout the project, I aimed to ensure maximum accessibility so that users of all backgrounds could benefit from the app's features on any platform.

###  Development Process  

#### UI/UX and Frontend Design  
The user interface was carefully designed to be intuitive and minimal. I used *HTML5* for semantic structure and *CSS3* for styling and layout. To enhance responsiveness and ensure a consistent grid system, I integrated *Bootstrap 5*, which allowed for mobile-first design principles.

The app includes:
- A *search bar* where users can enter any city name  
- A *current weather section* displaying temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions  
- An *hourly forecast section* showing updates for the upcoming hours  
- *Responsive layout adjustments* for mobile phones, tablets, and desktop screens  

The interface also adapts dynamically to API responses and gracefully handles cases such as invalid city names or connectivity issues. Color contrast and font sizes were carefully selected to improve readability and support users with different visual abilities.

#### Core Functionality with JavaScript  
I used *vanilla JavaScript* (without any frameworks or libraries) to manage user input, fetch weather data, and update the DOM dynamically. The logic is modular, making it easy to extend in the future.

JavaScript features include:
- Asynchronous API calls using fetch() and async/await  
- DOM manipulation to update content based on real-time data  
- Input validation and error handling  
- Unit conversion for temperature and wind speed (optional enhancement)

#### API Integration  
Weather data is sourced from the *OpenWeatherMap API*. I registered for an API key and structured calls to fetch both current weather data and short-term hourly forecasts.

Key data extracted includes:
- Temperature (in °C)  
- Weather description and icon  
- Humidity and wind speed  
- Hourly forecast for up to 5 hours  

API responses were parsed and displayed dynamically based on user search. For enhanced functionality, support for multiple languages and different units can easily be added in the future.

#### Deployment  
The application was deployed using *GitHub Pages*, ensuring it is accessible online without the need for backend hosting. Assets and API keys were managed carefully to maintain security while ensuring functionality.

#### Testing & Debugging  
I thoroughly tested the app on multiple browsers and devices to ensure:
- Layout responsiveness  
- Accurate API data rendering  
- Smooth transitions and updates  
- Graceful error handling for invalid input and network issues  

### Outcome  
*Sky Cast* is a fast, responsive, and user-friendly weather forecasting tool that showcases clean UI design and functional integration with third-party APIs. This project helped reinforce my understanding of asynchronous JavaScript, API handling, and responsive web design using only core technologies. Additionally, developing Sky Cast allowed me to further enhance my debugging strategies, optimize web performance, and deepen my knowledge of accessible web development best practices.
